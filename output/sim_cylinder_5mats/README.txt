Multi-mat decomp was done using VMIs constructed from an initial two-mat decomp,
with different basis materials:
    matdecomp1* - tissue + bone VMI basis materials
    matdecomp2* - water + aluminum VMI basis materials

An equal dose was used for both 80kVp and 140kVp acquisitions and is denoted in micro Gy.
This is the "per acquisition" dose. The total dual-energy CT dose is twice this value.
